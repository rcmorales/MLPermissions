   <div ><p>Bootstrap-select requires jQuery v1.9.1+, Bootstrapâ€™s dropdown.js component, and Bootstrap's CSS. 
      If you're not already using Bootstrap in your project, a precompiled version of the Bootstrap v3.4.1 minimum requirements 
      can be downloaded here. If using bootstrap-select with Bootstrap v4+, you'll also need Popper.js. For all of Bootstrap v4's 
      requirements, see Getting started. A precompiled version of the requirements will be made available in an upcoming release 
      of bootstrap-select.</p></div>
